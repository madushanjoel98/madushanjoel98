- Java
- Python
- PHP
- C#

I enjoy learning and experimenting with these languages, and I'm constantly seeking opportunities to expand my skills and knowledge.

## Projects

Here's a brief overview of some of the projects you can find in this repository:

- **Java Playground**: A collection of Java programs, including data structures, algorithms, and small applications.
- **Python Experiments**: Python scripts and projects, covering everything from web scraping to machine learning.
- **PHP Web Development**: Web applications, APIs, and websites developed with PHP and various frameworks.
- **C# Applications**: Desktop and web applications built using C# and the .NET framework.

Feel free to explore these projects and their respective folders to see the code and learn from the examples I've created.

## Languages

I enjoy coding in multiple languages, and this repository reflects that diversity. Here's a bit more about my preferences for each language:

- **Java**: I appreciate Java's strong typing and platform independence. It's great for building robust, cross-platform applications.

- **Python**: Python is my go-to language for quick prototyping and data manipulation. Its simplicity and extensive libraries make it a versatile choice.

- **PHP**: PHP is perfect for web development. I love creating web applications and dynamic websites using PHP and its various frameworks.

- **C#**: C# is my choice for Windows desktop applications and .NET development. It offers a great environment for building Windows-centric software.
